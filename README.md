#### Web-scraping-using-python
Once the code is written and run, a request for scraping is sent to your website of choice. If the request is approved, the server will send the desired data, allowing you to read the HTML or XML page. The code then automatically analyses the HTML or XML page, finds and parses the desired data.

The basic steps of web scraping with Python:

Step 1: Choose the URL from which you would like to scrape

Step 2: Read the page and find the data you would like to collect

Step 3: Write the code

Step 4: Run the code to extract the data

Step 5: Store the data in the necessary format
